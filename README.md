# Venture Into Greek: The Codex

### *Restoring the Original Ink*

**Venture Into Greek** is an intellectual heavyweight tool designed to move believers past English translations and into the original Greek text of the New Testament. 

This project is currently the engine for a bootstrapping nonprofit dedicated to service, education, and the preservation of truth. 

## 📜 The Mission
My time as a combat medic taught me that in a crisis, you need raw, reliable data—not a second-hand report. I believe every student of the Word deserves that same autonomy. We are building a tool that removes the "middleman" of translation, allowing users to see the truth in its original skin. 

## 🦖 The Personnel (The Ensemble)
The journey is guided by a cast of ancient observers and critics:
* **Theophilus:** The Patron. Oversees the big-picture "Why."
* **Silvanus:** The Smuggler (The Coyote). Brings the valuable manuscripts to your hands.
* **Apollos:** The Scribe. Master of the patterns and roots.
* **Celsus:** The Skeptic. An ornery anti-hero who challenges your accuracy.
* **Priscilla & Aquila:** The Guardians. Protectors of the final chapter seals.

## 🏛️ The Architecture
The app is designed using the **Golden Ratio (Phi: 1.618)** to ensure visual harmony and focus. It follows a three-stage iterative process:
1.  **The Crawl (Act I):** Guided introduction to the "Ink" and visual anchors.
2.  **The Walk (Act II):** Pattern matching and identifying the DNA of roots.
3.  **The Run (Act III):** High-stakes verse extraction from the raw Greek text.

## 🛠️ The Roadmap
* **Phase 1:** Complete Chapter 1 (The Awakening) with full ensemble interaction.
* **Phase 2:** Scale to 36 Chapters covering the core 320 words of the Koine Greek New Testament.
* **Phase 3:** Expand the "Underground Scriptorium" into Hebrew, Aramaic, and Latin modules.
